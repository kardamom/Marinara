<h1>Marinara</h1>
<p>A Grasshopper component library to generate the pasta forms mathematically defined in George L Legendre's 2011 book <i>Pasta By Design</i>. Also included are some of the forms from Joseph Choma's 2015 book <i>Morphing</i></p>

<p>This is a student research project for Spring Semester 2024. I am Master of Architecture candidate at the University of Southern California. My main aim is to learn C#, further my understanding of computational geometry, and learn about the internals of Grasshopper and Rhino.</p>
<p>This first stage is all about creating digital surfaces and curves, and from there drawings. Later on I will attempt to make physical models of the forms, avoiding 3d printing as much as possible.</p>
